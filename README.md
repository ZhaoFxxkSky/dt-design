## 📖 Introduction

dt-design is a React component library internally developed by the **Digital Business Department**, extending Ant Design 5.x. It abstracts and沉淀（consolidates）common business patterns into **out-of-the-box components**, boosting development velocity while reducing redundant code.

In addition, we provide several framework-agnostic utilities written in vanilla JavaScript:

* `ContextMenu` – right-click context menu
* `KeyEventListener` – global keyboard event binder

---

## 🎯 When to Use

* ✅ Ant Design's basic components are insufficient for complex business requirements
* ✅ Multiple projects share similar modules and need a unified implementation
* ✅ You want to extract general business logic to avoid duplicate development
* ✅ You need consistent UI specification and interaction behavior across products

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# npm
npm install dt-design

# yarn
yarn add dt-design

# pnpm
pnpm add dt-design
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { BlockHeader } from 'dt-design';

const App = () => <BlockHeader title="Category Title" background />;
```

---

## 📌 Tree-Shaking & On-Demand

ES modules are fully supported; import only what you need and the bundler will drop the rest automatically:

```ts
import { BlockHeader, CustomTable } from 'dt-design';
```

---

## 🧩 TypeScript First

Written entirely in TypeScript with complete type definitions for better IntelliSense and compile-time safety.

---

## 🛠 Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZhaoFxxkSky/dt-design
cd dt-design
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).  
We use [dumi](https://d.umijs.org/) for docs & component management.
